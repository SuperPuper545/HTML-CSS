          <dd>One late morning in 1908, Mr. Kartpoyan woke up in his estate and went to have breakfast.</dd>
          <dd>As was customary in his dwelling, the servant read to him the received letters. Kartopyan lived in Finland, letters came a little late.

          <dd>The letter said: "I want to start a war against everyone, and no one will stop me, because I ... I am an invincible villain"</dd>
          <legend>What to reply in a letter</legend>
          <dd>Confused by the letter, Mr. Kartpoyan burst into laughter and exclaimed, "An invincible villain? Ha! Well, I'll give him a taste of his own medicine!" With mischievous delight, he quickly penned a response: "Dear 'Invincible' Villain, Congratulations on your ambitious plans! But let me introduce you to my pet parrot, Captain Cuddles. He has a wicked squawk that can shatter glass, and his bad jokes have been known to bring even the hardiest villains to their knees. Beware, for his puns are truly invincible! </dd>

          <dd>He smirkingly sent off the letter, imagining the villain's confusion and wonderment upon receiving such an unexpected response.</dd>
          <legend>What is the unknown villain</legend>
          <dd>To his surprise, he never received an answer. As it turned out, the villain was so amused by this letter that he decided to think it over, and as it turned out later in the letter that the daughter of the "villain" remade, Karol of Sweden wanted to declare war on the former allies, but later changed his mind</dd>
